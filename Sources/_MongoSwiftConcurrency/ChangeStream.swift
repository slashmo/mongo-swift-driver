     * Attempt to get the next `T` from this change stream, returning `nil` if there are no results.

     * `ChangeStreamOptions` passed to the method that created this change stream) before returning `nil`.

     *    A `Result<T, Error>?` containing the next `T` in this change stream, an error if one occurred, or `nil` if
     *    there was no data.
     *
     *    If the result is an error, it is likely one of the following:
     *      - `MongoError.CommandError` if an error occurs while fetching more results from the server.
     *      - `MongoError.LogicError` if this function is called after the change stream has died.
     *     - `MongoError.LogicError` if this function is called and the session associated with this change stream is
     *       inactive.
     *      - `DecodingError` if an error occurs decoding the server's response.
